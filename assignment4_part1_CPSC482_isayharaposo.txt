Variables defined in the question:
Let L = The set of all tuples l = (s, f) where l is a lecture;
        s represents the starting time of l,
        and f represents the finishing time of l

Algorithm:
For all lectures (s, f) in L
    Sort L in increasing order of s
Endfor

Let C = The set of all classrooms c (initially empty/contains no classrooms)

While L is not empty
    Let c = A classroom (initially empty/contains no scheduled lectures)
    Let I = The set of all lectures l incompatible with c (initially empty)
    Pop l from the front of L
    Append l to c
    For each l in L
        If l is compatible with any and all other lectures in c
            Append l to c
        Else
            Append l to I
        Endif
    Endfor
    Append c to C
    Let L = I
Endwhile
