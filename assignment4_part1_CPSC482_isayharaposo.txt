Variables defined in the question:
Let L = The set of all tuples l = (s, f) where l is a lecture;
        s represents the starting time of l,
        and f represents the finishing time of l

Variables defined in the solution:

Algorithm:
For all lectures (s, f) in L
    Sort L in increasing order of s
